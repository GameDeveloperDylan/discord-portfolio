# ðŸ‘‹ hey there adventurer!

You've stumbled upon my free portfolio website template. This is a template created by yours truely, TheDylanator, which is great if you need a simple portfolio website.
This repository can be expanded on, edited or forked as long as you retain the original LICENSE file. 

### publishing the template

In my opinion, <a href="https://surge.sh">Surge</a> is the best way to publish web pages right from the CLI (command line interface) of your project, however if you have
another preferred web host feel free to use them. I'm going to show how to publish with Surge in this file.

To publish with Surge, first make sure you have node.js installed on your local machine. Then, run `npm install -g surge` in your project directory to install Surge. Once you've
installed Surge, sign in or create your account. Then, just run `surge publish` in your CLI to publish. You can use custom domains with Surge, however there will not be SSL
provided out of the box. If you don't have a custom domain, you can publish to a surge.sh subdomain, which includes free SSL.

### and that's it!

Enjoy your new website!
